## 💼 Experience
- **Prism.fm** — Led design efforts post-Series A, focusing on user experience optimization and pushing toward profitability
- **USA Today Network** — Crafted solutions for newsroom staff and audience members, increasing ad revenue and decreasing operational costs
- **Tennessee Tech University** — Taught agile software development while designing and shipping MVPs for real clients
- **Independent Design Consulting** — Partnered with startups and established companies to elevate their product experiences through strategic design interventions

## 🔭 Current Focus
I'm passionate about finding the intersection between business objectives and user needs. My work combines strategic thinking with tactical execution to create experiences that resonate. Currently exploring design tooling innovations and how AI is improving our workstreams as designers—while still balancing convergent and divergent thinking. I believe abductive thinking remains crucial in the design process, as explored in [Jon Kolko's work on sensemaking](https://www.jonkolko.com/writing/abductive-thinking-and-sensemaking).

## 🌱 What Drives Me
> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works." — Steve Jobs

I believe in designing with purpose and measuring success through meaningful metrics. Every pixel should serve your users and business goals.

## 🎓 Teaching & Mentorship
I find immense value in sharing knowledge and mentoring the next generation of designers and developers. My teaching experience has shown me that the best way to learn is to explain clearly to others.

## 🏔️ Beyond Design
When I'm not designing, you'll probably find me exploring Tennessee's stunning outdoors, camera in hand.
